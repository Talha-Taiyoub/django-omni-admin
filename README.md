### Omni Residency – A Comprehensive Hospitality Management Web Application by Rubytech

I'm excited to share **Omni Residency**, a robust web application developed under the banner of **Rubytech**. As part of this project, I worked on the backend, focusing on **database design**, **API development**, and building a **secure authentication system**. The project is now in its final stage, with only a few adjustments left.

You can explore the website at [Omni Residency](https://hotelomniresidency.com/).

**Omni Residency** is designed to manage multiple branches for a hospitality company, offering hotel rooms, gyms, and restaurants across different locations. Here's a breakdown of the key features:

#### For Guests:
- **Registration & Profile Management**: Guests can register, verify their email, and manage their profiles. A confirmation email is sent at every step.
- **Room Search & Booking**: Users can search for rooms by date, check availability, view discounts, add multiple rooms to the cart, and book those. They can pay online (payment gateway integration is in the final stage) and receive a confirmation email with a receipt.
- **Booking History**: Guests can review their booking history.
- **Restaurant & Gym Reservations**: Users can book tables at restaurants and purchase gym memberships.
- **Reviews & Stories**: Guests can leave reviews, view others’ feedback, and explore stories and tourist attractions shared by staff.

#### For Admins & Staff:
- **Branch Management**: Admins can create new branches and add restaurants, gyms, and rooms for each branch.
- **Staff Roles & Permissions**: Staff members can be assigned specific roles per branch. Managers can oversee one or more branches but are limited to their assigned areas.
- **Room & Booking Management**: Staff can manage room categories, confirm bookings, assign rooms, and update room statuses (e.g., booked, occupied, or out of order).
- **Dashboard for Branch Managers**: Managers can track guest statistics (upcoming, in-house), revenue, unpaid dues, and more. They can also manually manage guest profiles and bookings, apply discounts and approve reservations.
- **CMS Control**: Admins and staff can manage media, including images and sliders, through the integrated CMS section.

**Key Challenges**:
The most interesting and challenging aspect for me was developing the API for searching rooms by date, ensuring efficiency and performance. Security was a priority throughout, especially in building the authentication system.

I’m really proud of how **Omni Residency** is shaping up, and I look forward to completing the final touches. Stay tuned for updates!
